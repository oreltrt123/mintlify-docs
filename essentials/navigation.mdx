# Features / Capabilities  

Zerlo is designed with a set of **powerful AI-driven tools** that make 3D game creation fast, intuitive, and scalable. These features empower creators at every level — from hobbyists to studios.  

---

## AI-Powered World Generation  
Automatically build immersive 3D landscapes, terrains, and environments. Users can generate forests, cities, or entire worlds with a single prompt.  

---

## Intelligent NPC Creation  
AI designs and animates non-playable characters (NPCs) that respond dynamically to player actions, giving games lifelike behavior without manual scripting.  

---

## Natural Language Interface  
Instead of coding, creators describe their game logic in plain English.  
Example: *“When the player enters the cave, spawn a dragon.”* Zerlo instantly translates this into functional game mechanics.  

---

## Cross-Platform Export  
Games built with Zerlo can be exported to:  
- **PC**  
- **Mobile**  
- **VR**  

This ensures creators reach players across devices with no extra setup.  

---

## Real-Time Collaboration *(optional)*  
Multiple creators can work on the same game simultaneously, allowing students, teams, or studios to collaborate like they would in Google Docs.  

---

## Template Library & Iterative Support  
- Pre-made templates for common genres (RPG, FPS, Puzzle, Adventure)  
- AI suggestions for improvements and design refinements  
- Faster prototyping through reusable components
