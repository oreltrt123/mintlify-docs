# Risk Analysis / Challenges

While Zerlo presents a groundbreaking approach to 3D game creation, it also faces several risks and challenges that must be managed strategically.

---

## Technical Risks

- AI-generated content may produce inconsistent or low-quality results initially.  
- Scaling cloud infrastructure to handle large numbers of simultaneous users.  
- Compatibility issues with multiple platforms (PC, mobile, VR).

---

## Market & Competition Risks

- Established game engines (Unity, Unreal) may expand into AI-driven tools.  
- Emerging no-code platforms could replicate similar features.  
- User reluctance to adopt AI for creative workflows.

---

## User Adoption Risks

- Learning curve for non-technical users despite simplification.  
- Dependence on internet connectivity and cloud resources.  
- Retention challenges if the platform does not continuously deliver value.

---

## Mitigation Strategies

- Continuous AI model improvement and quality assurance.  
- Scalable cloud architecture with redundancy and monitoring.  
- User education through tutorials, guides, and community support.  
- Phased feature rollout to gather feedback and optimize adoption.
