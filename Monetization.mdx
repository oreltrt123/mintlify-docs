# Monetization

Zerlo’s monetization strategy is designed to ensure sustainability, scalability, and continuous growth.  
We focus on creating multiple revenue streams that align with our mission of democratizing 3D game creation through AI.

## Primary Revenue Streams

1. **Subscription Plans**  
   Users can subscribe to tiered plans (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) with varying levels of access to AI tools, rendering power, and storage.

2. **Marketplace Commissions**  
   Developers can sell AI-generated assets, environments, and full game templates. Zerlo takes a small commission on each sale.

3. **Cloud Rendering Credits**  
   Users requiring high-performance rendering or multiplayer hosting can purchase credits, ensuring flexible scalability.

4. **Enterprise Licensing**  
   Game studios, educational institutions, and enterprises can license Zerlo’s technology for internal use.

## Future Expansion Opportunities

- **Advertising Partnerships**: Integrating sponsored assets or in-engine ads.  
- **Education Programs**: Paid training courses for schools, academies, and individuals.  
- **Premium AI Models**: Access to advanced AI generation tools available as add-ons.

## Key Advantage

By combining subscriptions with scalable cloud services and a thriving marketplace, Zerlo creates a self-reinforcing ecosystem that benefits both individual creators and the platform itself.
